> 独立主格结构：非谓语的逻辑主语和主句的主语不是同一个

- 主格：有一个逻辑主语（不是真正主句的主语），但是它也有人格和意义，所以称之为主格

比如make oneself understood in Enghlish

- 及物动词的宾语拉到前面去
- 不及物动词没~~有done形式~~

   三、独立主格的概念
   知识精讲

8. 独立主格结构的形式和功能
   (1) 独立主格结构多用于书面语，通常由一个名词 / 代词和一个修饰语组成。
   (2) 独立主格结构本身不是一个句子，而是用来修饰整个句子的一组词，其作用
   相当于一个状语从句或并列句； 独立主格结构在句子中常用来表示谓语动词发
   生的时间、原因、条件、行为方式或伴随情况等。
   Animals are our friends. We should protect them. → Animals being our friends, we should protect them. 2. 独立主格结构的位置
   所谓“独立主格结构”并非真正独立，它与主句紧密联系在一起，共同表达一个完
   整的意思； 独立主格结构可放于句首或句尾，用逗号和主句隔开。
   表示时间，条件或原因时，相当于一个状语从句，一般放在句首
   Leaves falling, I suddenly notice autumn is coming. （名词 + 非谓语动词）
   The meeting over, we all went home . （名词 + 副词）
   (2) 表示伴随情况或补充说明时，相当于一个并列句，通常放在句末
   He turned to me, his eyes sleepy.（名词 + 形容词）
   The new teacher came in, a smile on her face.（名词 + 介词短语）
   【甲】+谓语动词 【乙】+谓语动词
   Animals are our friends. We should protect them.
   7
   Animals are our friends, and we should protect them. [√]
   Being our friends, we should protect them. [❌]
   Animals being our friends, we should protect them. [√]

   五、独立主格与 with 的复合结构的写作应用

9. 刻画人物
   “一个人靠在树上”这一简单的动作就可以拆分为如下的一系列动作“面”：
   头【耷拉】着，他【背靠】在树上，他【反思】之前发生的一切。
   (With) his head drooping, he leaned on the tree, reflecting on what had happened. 类似的，就可以借助独立主格或者 with 的复合结构构建“局部和整体”的描述：
   例 1. [整体] 她跳起来，[局部] 她的脸容光焕发。
   She sprang to her feet, (with) her face beaming. _________________________________________________________________ 例 2. [局部] 眼睛充满/闪烁着泪水，[整体] Tim 求我帮忙。
   (with) His eyes filled/glistening with tears, Tim begged for my help. (with) Tears filling his eyes, Tim begged for my help. (with) Tears glistening in his eyes, Tim begged for my help. _________________________________________________________________ 例 3. [局部] 心中充满愤怒，[整体] 他攥紧了拳头。
   His heart filled with rage, he clenched his fists. he waved his fists over the kids. he trembled from head/top to toe. 例 4. [整体] 他僵立在原地，[局部] 双臂发沉、膝盖发软。
   He was rooted to the spot, his arms heavy and his knees weak.
   ① (with) A to do/doing/done/形容词/介词短语, B ... ② B ..., (with) A to do/doing/done/形容词/介词短语.
   11

_________________________________________________________________

2. 刻画环境
   例 1. 爆竹声充斥大街小巷，人们看着春晚，分享着趣闻。 With the streets filled with the sound of firecrackers, people watch the Spring
   Festival Gala, exchanging anecdotes. 例 2. 一声巨响打破了寂静，它升到空中，消失在夜色中。
   With a roar breaking the silence, it rose into the sky and off into the night. 例 3. 【人】我凝视着星空，【环境】风吹拂着我的头发。
   I gazed at the starry sky, the wind blowing my hair. I stood on the top of the mountain, the warm sunshine touching my skin. 3. 表示逻辑
   例 4. 天气允许的话，会议就在花园里开。
   If weather permits, the meeting will be held in the garden. Weather permitting, the meeting will be held in the garden. 例 5. 条件允许的话，我希望有自己的房间。【咨询】
   If conditions permit, I prefer to have my own room. Conditions permitting, I prefer to have my own room. 例 6. 没有事情可做，我出去散步了。
   (With) Nothing to do, I went out for a walk. 4. with 复合结构与独立主格的区别
   一般情况下，独立主格和 with 的复合结构可以相互转化，只是加不加 with
   的区别。但是有两个点需要注意：
3. 由于 with 是介词，因此后面如果加代词，需要改成宾格：
   12
   她默然，我离开：
   独立主格：She saying nothing, I left. with 的复合结构：With her saying nothing, I left. 2. 独立主格更加简洁，可以省去（也可保留）修饰词（冠词、所有格等）：
   with 的复合结构：He came in, with a cup in his hand. 独立主格：He came in, cup in hand. 3. with 等复合结构可以作定语，而独立主格不可以：
   My grandma lives in a house 【with big trees in front of it】. My grandma lives in a house, big trees in front of it. She took a book with TT’s name on it. She took a book, TT’s name on it. 4. with 的复合结构可以变成 without 以表否定含义，此时不能直接去掉 without
   变成独立主格：
   with 的符合结构：Without anything left in the freezer, she had to eat outside. 独立主格：Anything left in the freezer, she had to eat outside. [错误]
   Nothing left in the freezer, she had to eat outside. [正确]
   Without the slightest hesitation,
