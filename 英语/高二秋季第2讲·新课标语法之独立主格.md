> 独立主格结构：非谓语的逻辑主语和主句的主语不是同一个

- 独立：逻辑主语相对于真正的主语独立
- 主格：有一个逻辑主语（不是真正主句的主语），但是它也有人格和意义，所以称之为主格

比如 make oneself understood in Enghlish

- 及物动词的宾语拉到前面去
- 不及物动词没~~有 done 形式~~

# 独立主格的概念

## 1. 独立主格结构的形式和功能

1.  独立主格结构多用于书面语，通常由一个名词 / 代词和一个修饰语组成
2.  立主格结构本身不是一个句子，而是用来修饰整个句子的一组词，其作用相当于一个状语从句或并列句； 独立主格结构在句子中常用来表示谓语动词发生的时间、原因、条件、行为方式或伴随情况等。
   Animals are our friends. We should protect them. → Animals being our friends, we should protect them.

## 2. 独立主格结构的位置

- 所谓“独立主格结构”并非真正独立，它与主句紧密联系在一起，共同表达一个完整的意思； 独立主格结构可放于句首或句尾，用逗号和主句隔开。
1.  表示时间，条件或原因时，相当于一个状语从句，一般放在句首
     Leaves falling, I suddenly notice autumn is coming. （名词 + 非谓语动词）
     The meeting over, we all went home . （名词 + 副词）
2.  表示伴随情况或补充说明时，相当于一个并列句，通常放在句末
   He turned to me, his eyes sleepy.（名词 + 形容词）
   The new teacher came in, a smile on her face.（名词 + 介词短语）

| 【甲】+谓语动词                 | 【乙】+谓语动词                |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Animals are our friends. | We should protect them. |

 合并之后就是:
Animals are our friends, and we should protect them.
~~Being our friends, we should protect them.~~
**Animals** being our friends, we should protect them.

# 独立主格与 with 的复合结构的写作应用

## 1. 刻画人物

[[动作链]][[动作面]][[续写]]

“一个人靠在树上”这一简单的动作就可以拆分为如下的一系列动作“面”：
头【耷拉】着，他【背靠】在树上，他【反思】之前发生的一切。
(With) his head drooping, he leaned on the tree, reflecting on what had happened.

> 类似的，就可以借助独立主格或者 with 的复合结构构建“局部和整体”的描述：

「例3」.，
 「例4」. ，。
,
① (with) A to do/doing/done/形容词/介词短语, B ... ② B ..., (with) A to do/doing/done/形容词/介词短语.

1.  ⬇

   | [整体] 她跳起来              | [局部] 她的脸容光焕发             |
   | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
   | She sprang to her feet | (with) her face beaming. |

She sprang to her feet, (with) her face beaming.

2.  ⬇

   | [局部] 眼睛充满/闪烁着泪水                               | [整体] Tim 求我帮忙。          |
   | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
   | (with) His eyes filled/glistening with tears, | Tim begged for my help. |

(with) His eyes filled/glistening with tears, Tim begged for my help.

(with) Tears filling his eyes, Tim begged for my help.

(with) Tears glistening in his eyes, Tim begged for my help.

3.  ⬇
   
   | [局部] 心中充满愤怒                 | [整体] 他攥紧了拳头            |
   | --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
   | His heart filled with rage, | he clenched his fists. |

- 整体的描写也可以换成 he waved his fists over the kids/he <u>trembled from head</u>/<u>top to toe</u>.

1.  ⬇
   
   | [整体] 他僵立在原地                | [局部] 双臂发沉、膝盖发软           |
   | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
   | He was rooted to the spot, | his arms heavy and his knees weak. |

## 2. 刻画环境

5.  爆竹声充斥大街小巷，人们看着春晚，分享着趣闻。
   With the streets filled with the sound of firecrackers, people watch the Spring
   Festival Gala, exchanging anecdotes.

6.  一声巨响打破了寂静，它升到空中，消失在夜色中。
   With a roar breaking the silence, it rose into the sky and off into the night.

7.  我凝视着星空，风吹拂着我的头发。
   I gazed at the starry sky, the wind blowing my hair. I stood on the top of the mountain, the warm sunshine touching my skin.

## 3. 表示逻辑

8.  天气允许的话，会议就在花园里开。
   If weather permits, the meeting will be held in the garden.

   ➡Weather permitting, the meeting will be held in the garden.

9.  条件允许的话，我希望有自己的房间。[[咨询信]]
   If conditions permit, I prefer to have my own room. Conditions permitting, I prefer to have my own room.

10. 没有事情可做，我出去散步了。
    (With) Nothing to do, I went out for a walk.

## 4. with 复合结构与独立主格的区别

 一般情况下，独立主格和 with 的复合结构可以相互转化，只是加不加 with 的区别。但是有两个点需要注意：

1.  由于 with 是介词，因此后面如果加代词，需要改成宾格：
   她默然，我离开

   | 独立主格                        | with 的复合结构                       |
   | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
   | She saying nothing, I left. | With her saying nothing, I left. |

2.  独立主格更加简洁，可以省去（也可保留）修饰词（冠词、所有格等）：

   他端着杯子进来了

   | 独立主格                     | with 的复合结构                          |
   | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
   | He came in, cup in hand. | He came in, with a cup in his hand. |

3.  with 等复合结构可以作[[后置定语]]，而独立主格不~~可以~~：

   | 独立主格                                                   | with 的复合结构                                                   |
   | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
   | My grandma lives in a house, big trees in front of it. | My grandma lives in a house【with big trees in front of it】. |
   | She took a book, TT’s name on it.                      | She took a book with TT’s name on it                        |

4.  with 的复合结构可以变成 without 以表否定含义，此时不~~能直接去掉 without
   变成独立主格~~：

   - with 的符合结构：Without anything left in the freezer, she had to eat outside.

   - 独立主格：~~Anything left in the freezer, she had to eat outside.~~
     Nothing left in the freezer, she had to eat outside.
     Without the slightest hesitation,

5.  with + n. = perp.

独立主格结构主要负责去写作文用的
