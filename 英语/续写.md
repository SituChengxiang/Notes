## 动作描写

谓语动词铁三角：时态，语态，主谓一致

### 动作链：A，B and C || having done

也可以从肢体面部到表情心理构建
比如：

1.  She dashed forward.knelt down andl
    gathered her son intoherarms.  
    抱住儿子：冲向前 ➡ 跪下来 ➡ 一把抱住！
2.  <u>Having fought</u> in the war for years，the soldier <u>returned</u> his home, <u>only to find</u> his wife had gone with someone else.
    - Having done 主动形式表示已经完成
3.  He queled for 3 hours，and was told that the tickets had been sold out.
    - had been done 被动
    - ha
4.  Harry received the Nimbus 2000 and was so happy that he <u>was at a loss</u> what to do. 1. be at a loss (about) sth.(what to do)表示不知道去做什么 ，sth.可以换很多东西
5.  先后区分：尽管 doing 可以表伴随，仍要考虑逻辑的关系，从大到小，从先到后
    1.  He went to school, finding zhe door was locked.
        - 此处 lock 的是学校的门
    2.  Finding the door was locked, he went to school.
        - 此处的 lock 的是其他地方（不是学校）的门
    - Doing + V + doing,按照从大到小，从先到后的逻辑安排 doing 的前后

### 动作面：dong+谓语动词+doing||谓语动词,doing and doing|| don,谓语动词||done,谓语动词，doing

6.  Standing beside the empty road, they looked up into the sky feeling the precious peace from within.
    - doing+谓语动词+doing
7.  He clapped his hands with excitement nodding and smiling
    - 谓语动词,doing and doing 结构
8.  He was overwhelmed with joy singing and dancing in the rain.
    - 谓语动词，doing and doing
9.  Encouraged by the teacher's words, Lucy raised her hand whispering, "I volunteer.
    - 前面不用 being done 因为 volunteer 作为一个相对主动的动作是主动态
    - done,谓语动词
10. Terrified by the scenein front of him,he was rooted to the spot being at a loss what to say.
    - root 根 ，spot ：n.地点，场所; 斑点，污点,on spot 即为当场
    - done, 谓语动词, doing
11. 贝贝坐在泳池边,双臂低垂,思考自己是白熊猫还是黑熊猫。
    - 注意这句的低垂的主语是双臂，没有独立主格，用  
      <u>With his arms drooping</u>, Beibei sat beside the pool wondering whether he was white or black.
12. 脑袋套拉着，Susan 靠在树干上反思着发生的一切。
    <u>（With）her head drooping,</u> Susan leant on a tree reflecting on what had happened.
    - 同上句用 with 的复合结构
    - reflect on 可以说“反思”
    - had happened 已经发生（你不能反思还没发生的啊）

13. 春节：爆竹声充岸大街小巷，人们把酒言欢
    - (With) the sound of firecrackers filling the streets, people feast on grand meals,chatting happily.
14. 中秋：明月高悬天际，人们把酒言欢
    - (With) the bright moom hanging up in the sky people feast on grand meals chatting happily.

- 13，14 两句独立主格，如果一个词修饰的不是本句的主语。前面可以把形容的东西补上去

- 动作链到动作面，从整体到局部，从先到后
