## 读后续写——语言描写
读后续写【动作、心里、情绪语言、环境】
### 1. 口语中的简单句
日常的对话多使用简单句，并不会像书面语那么冗长复杂，如下面这段对话：  
—“Hey, girl, you want to have noodles？”   
—“Oh, yes, but I have no money on me,” she replied.   
—“Oh, that's nothing. I'll treat you today,” the owner said, “come in.”   
而且，在长句中插入简短的语言描写，可以改变文字的节奏，使其更有韵律感

### 2. 正确使用标点符号
1.  说话人+说话内容
“说”后用逗号，引号内第一个字母大写，句尾标点符号放在引号内。
如：He said, “You are my best friend!”  
2.  说话内容+说话人
陈述句引号内用逗号，引号外第一个字母小写；  
疑问句或感叹句引号内用问号或感叹号，引号外第一个字母小写。且“某人说”可以写作“sb. said”也可以写作“said
sb.”。
    1. “Yes,” he said. 
    2.  “You may both go,” said Pa. 
    3.  “Don’t move,” she said to William in a soft voice.    
- 人在前人在后都可以

3. 说话内容+说话人+说话内容
“某人说”可以写作“sb. said”也可以写作“said sb.”；  
“某人说”前面：引号内用逗号，引号外第一个字母小写。“某人说”后面如果用句号，则后面引号内第一个字母大写；  
“某人说”后面如果用逗号，则后面引号内第一个字母小写。  
    1. “That’s cool,” he said. “Can I have a try?”   
    2. “You’d better let me go,” teased[开玩笑，调戏] her twin brother, William. “There are dangers all over this prairie.”  
    3. “You can go any place you want,” Beto said, “but I think you’ll find what you need.”

### 3. 避免重复使用 say
如果续写中语言描写较多，那么一定要避免通篇都是“said”，而要灵活多变地使用表示“说”的动词，比如以下这两个例子：  
例 1. I <u>laughed</u>, "There's no way! I'm 55!" But he persisted, and before I knew what I had done, I was enrolled for classes in English and crafts. "This is only an experiment," I <u>warned</u> him, but he just smiled.   
翻译：我笑道：“没办法！我 55 岁了！”但他坚持了下来，我还不知道自己做了什么，就报名参加了英语和手工艺课。“这只是一个实验，”我警告他，但他只是笑了。  
例 2. “What is the matter now?” asked his wife. “I just can’t remember why I come back and where I am supposed to be going on such a hot summer day,” replied the professor. However, the real reason was that he forgot where he had left his children. Sensing something wrong, Mrs Smith didn’t believe his words, because whenever he told a lie, he would usually blink his eyes quickly. “Tell me the truth,” ordered his wife. “As you told me, I didn’t forget where I put the name of that town, but I forget the station where I left our children!” whispered the professor, his voice trembling. “What a bad memory!” shouted his wife.   
翻译：“现在怎么了？”他的妻子问道，“我只是记不清我为什么回来，也不知道我在这么炎热的夏天应该去哪里。”教授回答道。然而，真正的原因是他忘了把孩子们留在哪里了。史密斯太太觉察到有什么不对劲，她不太相信他的话，因为每当他说谎，他通常会快速地眨眼。“告诉我真相。”他的妻子命令道。“正如你告诉我的，我没有忘记我把那个城镇的名字放在哪里了，但我忘了我把孩子们留在哪个车站了！”教授低声说，声音颤抖着。“记性真差！“他妻子喊道。

### 4. 说话的语气
例 1. Ronan pawed the ground nervously. "I'm sure Firenze thought he was acting for
the best, " he said in his gloomy voice.   
- in a gloomy voice 以一个忧郁的声音  


例 2. "Yeah," said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, "I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back. G'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir."   


例 3. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, "Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!"   


例 4. "Hagrid," said Dumbledore, sounding relieved.   
- sounding relieved.听起来如释重负
- sounding ~ and ~
- suonding half ~, half ~
- sound 听起来

例 5. "I know you haven 't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. "But you're different. Everyone knows you're the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of."
- exasperated 恼怒的（不要求）

### 5. 用对话推动情节发展
续写中还可以用对话来推动情节的发展，比如下面这个例子：
Suddenly he burst into laughter. “With that gun?” asked the professor. Strangely, he didn’t seem frightened of Carl any more. He continued, “You can’t shoot with that antique gun. You should have put it in the museum actually.” “Is this really an antique gun?” asked Carl. “How much is it worth?” “It was worth about 17,000 dollars,” said the professor. “But now you can get 10 dollars for it.” “Why?” asked Carl. The professor replied, “Because, you see, its end is missing.”   
翻译：他突然大笑起来。“用那把枪？”教授问道。奇怪的是，他似乎不再害怕 Carl 了。他接着说，“你不能用那把古董枪射击。你真该把它放在博物馆里。”“这真的是一把古董枪吗？”卡尔问，“值多少钱？“它大约值 17,000 美元，”教授说。“但是现在你可以得到 10 美元。”“为什么？”Carl 问。教授回答说：“因为，你看，它的末端不见了。”

但是要注意的是：**在续写中不能添加过多对话**，使用过多的对话, 会显得篇
幅累赘且很难在限定的词数里把整个后续的情节发展补充完整。
